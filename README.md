# Trybewallet

This project was developed during the web development course at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). <br>
The project is a front end application designed to be a expense controller. You can enter expenses in many diferent currencies and the App will <br>
make the convertion to Brazilian Real based on the currency price at the moment.

## Obervations
  The project could not be completed 100% in the time given, as there were much more to study and projects to be carried out,
  so some features were never implemented. With time maybe i can go back to review this and add the Edit button to chage an expense, 
  so for now you can only delete it. <br> <br>
